# Delta Solivia RS485 component for ESPHome

This component for ESPHome can be used to directly read measurement/statistics data from the RS485 port of _some_ Delta Solivia inverters. It does not require having a Solivia Gateway device, but will work if you have one.

## SYNOPSIS

The document "Public Solar Inverter Communication Protocol (Version 1.2)", from Delta Energy Systems (Germany) GmbH, documents the protocol that Delta Solivia inverters use over their RS485 port. There are dozens of Solivia models, and about 10 different protocol variants.

This component only supports one variant, supported by the following inverters:
* SOLIVIA 2.5 EU G3
* SOLIVIA 3.0 EU G3
* SOLIVIA 3.3 EU G3
* SOLIVIA 3.6 EU G3
* SOLIVIA 2.5 NA G4
* SOLIVIA 3.0 NA G4
* SOLIVIA 3.3 NA G4
* SOLIVIA 3.6 NA G4
* SOLIVIA 4.4 NA G4
* SOLIVIA 5.0 NA G4
* SOLIVIA 2.5 AP G3
* SOLIVIA 3.0 AP G3
* SOLIVIA 3.3 AP G3
* SOLIVIA 3.6 AP G3

The component does not perform any checks to see if it's talking to a supported inverter, but just assumes it does, so using it for a different type of inverter will probably cause the component to either crash or to provide incorrect data. Nothing bad will happen with your inverter if you do try this.

## HARDWARE

### MCU

The component should work on most ESP32 boards, and probably also ESP8266 boards, although I have only tested with ESP32-C3 "SuperMini" boards.

### RS-485 modules

#### MAX485-based RS-485-to-TTL modules

These modules are cheap and easy to get. They require explicit flow control (see below, "ESPHome setup") for the component to be able to write to the RS485 bus.

##### Pinout

It's not a requirement to use these exact GPIO pins on the ESP32, you can use others if convenient. Just make sure you change the YAML configuration to reflect the different pins.


| ESP32 | RS485 module | Purpose      |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| GPIO4 | DI           | TX           |
| GPIO3 | RO           | RX           |
| GPIO2 | RE + DE      | Flow control |

#### Modules with automatic flow control

RS485 boards that have automatic flow control will take care of the correct signalling automatically.

### Connecting to the inverter

The inverter should have one or more ports that accept RJ45 ("Ethernet") connectors. The pinout depends on the inverter model (G3 or G4):

The TX_A and RX_B pins should connect to the A and B pins on the RS-485 module, respectively. The RS-485 GND pin isn't used.

If you don't have the necessary tools to crimp Ethernet cables, or you just want a quick solution, cut off a length of Ethernet cable with connector already attached and connect the TX_A and RX_B wires to the RS-485 module.

#### With or without gateway

If you have a Solivia gateway, you need to set the `has_gateway` to `true`. It will let the component leave requesting updates to the gateway, to prevent having two primaries active on the bus. Note: even though the component will be passive (not writing) when combined with a gateway, you still need to configure the flow control pin if your board requires manual flow control. This is to make sure the pin is set to LOW during component setup, to prevent locking up the bus.

The `update_interval` option of the component serves different purposes depending on whether you have a gateway or not. With a gateway, it will automatically be set to a low value (0.5s) to prevent missing updates sent by the inverters. Without a gateway, it will be the interval at which the component will request a single inverter (in a round-robin fashion) to send an update. The default of 10 seconds should be sufficient, although you can decrease it if you want faster updates or if you have more than one inverter.

The `throttle` option for each inverter will limit the amount of state updates sent back to HA. This is especially relevant if you have a gateway, since it will request updates for each inverter about every second (remember that each state update will also be stored in HA's database). The default throttle interval is 10 seconds. Internally, this is implemented using a [`throttle_average`](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/#throttle-average) filter.
